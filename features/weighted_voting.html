<h2>Weighted voting</h2>
<p>This feature allows you to configure a proposals component to use a weighted voting system. This means that each vote can have a different weight and the result of the vote is calculated as the sum of all the weights.</p>
<p>Weighted voting can have different presentations that can be registered in a manifest. Admins can then choose between what type of voting they want for their proposals according to the different manifests registered (classic is always available).</p>
<p>Some manifests are included by default in Decidim Awesome, if you consider to create (or pay) for a new one, please open a PR or contact us.</p>
<p>For instance, here is how the 3-flag voting system looks like:</p>
