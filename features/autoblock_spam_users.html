<h2>Autoblock spam users</h2>
<p>In order to prevent illicit content (spam messages) from being published on the platform, a mechanism will be implemented to auto-block users. When a user is blocked, their content becomes inaccessible (if they are unblocked, it is accessible again).</p>
<img src="{{ page.image | relative_url }}" alt="Autoblock">
<ul>
    <li>Allow or disable user auto-blocking.</li>
    <li>Allow defining the weight (in integers) of the rules.</li>
    <li>Allow defining the threshold from which the autolock is applied (>=2 for example).</li>
    <li>Add links to be able to list users who meet these rules (optional).</li>
    <li>Define whitelist rules that would bypass autoblocking.</li>
</ul>
