<h2>Assign admins to specific scopes and prevent them modify anything else</h2>
<p>Convert any user on the platform (that is not currently an admin) to a limited subset of participatory spaces or event components. Just add users to a box and scope them to some constraints. These users will see the "Edit" button in everywhere they have permissions. Any access to non allowed zones will redirect the user to the admin index page.</p>
